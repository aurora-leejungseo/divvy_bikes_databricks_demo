# Databricks Delta Live Tables (DLT) Demonstration

Welcome to the Databricks Delta Live Tables (DLT) Demonstration repository! This resource is tailored for replicating the Delta Live Tables demo, with a specific emphasis on divvy bike-sharing data.

## Getting Started

To kickstart the demo, follow these simple steps:

1. **Execute Python Files:** Run the provided Python files to generate the necessary dataset for the demo.

2. **Construct a Databricks Pipeline:** For an immersive experience, we recommend building a Databricks pipeline. This pipeline will enhance the efficiency of both batch and streaming operations with real-time data.

## Usage

Once you've executed the Python files and set up the Databricks pipeline, leverage the `dlt-sql-streaming-divvybikes` SQL file within the pipeline. This file is designed to streamline your processes and ensure you're working with the most up-to-date data.
